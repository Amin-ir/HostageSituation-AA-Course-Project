## About the Game
This is a strategic point-and-click game built in Unity, inspired by titles like XCOM. It features an isometric view where players control an agent infiltrating a building full of enemies, with the goal of completing missions through rescuing hostages. The gameplay revolves around stealth, tactical planning, and environment interactions.

## Why This Exists
Honestly, this project wasn’t meant to be a big deal — it started as a simple concept for a lecture in the **Advanced Algorithms** course at university. The idea was to showcase how algorithms can be applied in game AI, pathfinding, and decision-making. But, like most side projects, it evolved a bit along the way.

## Key Features
- **Isometric strategic gameplay** — plan your moves carefully!
- **Enemy Scenario-based AI** — with patrolling, detecting, and chasing behaviors.
- **Interactive objects** — trigger alarms, manipulate the environment, or distract enemies.
- **Throw mechanic** — toss objects to lure or mislead enemies.
- **Escort mechanic** — safely guide NPCs out of dangerous areas.
- **Animated menu** — a dynamic scene with dark, tactical vibes.

## Architecture
The game attempts to use an **Entity Component System (ECS)** architecture to keep gameplay elements modular and scalable. The focus was on separating data (components) from behavior (systems) and organizing entities dynamically, though it’s still a work in progress.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the project in Unity (tested with Unity 2022.1.24f1).
3. Hit **Play** in the editor.

## What's Next?
Since this was tied to a university lecture, there’s no strict roadmap, but ideas for future improvements include:
- Smarter enemy AI with more complex behaviors.
- Refining the ECS implementation.
- Adding more interactive objects and mission types.

## Contributing
This project was mainly for academic purposes, but if you have ideas or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or PR!

Thanks for checking this out! It’s a small, scrappy project, but it was a fun way to blend algorithms and game design.
